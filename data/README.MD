# Data Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains all data files for the project.

## Structure

- `raw/`: Original, unmodified data files
  - Store original data files here
  - Never modify files in this directory
  - Document data sources and dates
- `final/`: Cleaned and processed data files
  - Contains transformed and cleaned data
  - Files here are generated by notebooks
  - Use clear naming conventions (e.g., cleaned_data_2024.csv)

## Usage Guidelines

1. Always store original data in `raw/`
2. Document any data cleaning steps in notebooks
3. Save processed data with descriptive names
4. Include data version in filename when applicable
